    <h2>Dear Kuya Mik,</h2>
    <p>
      Happy Happy Birthday to my Kuya Mik! Today is your special day, and I just want you to know how much you really mean to me. I really miss bonding and having you here in the PH. We haven’t talked in a while, but always remember that I miss you, and let’s catch up soon! We have a lot of stuff to talk about, especially this Capstone project that me and my team are working on.
    </p>
    <p>
      Anyway, I hope you have an amazing day filled with joy, laughter, and everything you love. May this year bring you new opportunities and incredible experiences. Just remember to take care of yourself and enjoy life to the fullest.
    </p>
    <p>
      As you celebrate with Kuya Jeroen, know that I’m cheering you on from afar and wishing I could be there to join in the fun. I can’t wait for the day we can finally meet again and create new memories together. Enjoy your day to the fullest, and remember, you’re always in my heart!
    </p>
    <p>  
      Once again, Happy Birthday to my amazing brother!
    </p>
    <p>  
      With love and best wishes,
    </p>
